Kotlin Js Mocha Test Demo
=========================

Run Kotlin-js code with mocha. Modified from official mocha examples by removing the slow `installMocha` tasks from gradle, instead, use npm tests to install it in the beginning.

Run:

```
npm install
./gradlew test
```

You will see test report.
